## GLS ASSESSMENT â€“ SaaS Backend System

### 1. Overview
gls is a **SaaS backend system** for logistics and transport companies.  
It manages **customers** and their **orders**, while ensuring that **notifications** are automatically triggered when order statuses are updated.

The app is based on a **microservices architecture**, with services communicating via **REST APIs** (synchronous) and **RabbitMQ messaging** (asynchronous).  
A shared external module (`shared-models`) ensures consistency of DTOs and entities across services.
